Through careful analysis of the stocks given in both 2017 and 2018, i believe that investing in DQ
should be avoided. Yes, in the year 2017 it saw an increase in return, but in 2018 it had an uneasy 
negative return of 62.6%. I advise steve to take a further look into ENPH and RUN, both of which 
had positive returns in both years.
